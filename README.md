# CS 340 – Client/Server Development
## Portfolio Reflection

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that connected to MongoDB, and reused it in Project Two for the interactive dashboard. Writing code this way helped keep things clean and reusable. Instead of duplicating database logic, I just imported the CRUD class and used it in different dashboard widgets. This made debugging easier and reduced repetition. I could easily adapt the module in future projects that need MongoDB access by changing only a few parameters.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I started by breaking the problem down into parts: setting up the database, writing reusable functions, and designing the dashboard interface. Compared to past assignments, this one felt more realistic—it mimicked what it’s like to work with client requirements and develop something modular. I learned to focus on creating scalable backend code first, then build the frontend around it. That approach will help me when working with future clients and database-driven apps.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems using logic, structure, and creativity. In this case, my work helped a fictional rescue-dog training company search and analyze shelter data faster. That kind of tool could save time and resources in the real world, helping staff make faster decisions about which dogs to train. Projects like this show how tech can support real missions by turning raw data into actionable tools.
